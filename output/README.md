# Outputs of interest can be found here

* The final GTF of lncRNA transcripts can be found [here](https://github.com/course-fish546-2023/zach-lncRNA/blob/main/output/merged_final_lncRNAs.gtf).

* The final count matrix of lncRNAs can be found [here](https://github.com/course-fish546-2023/zach-lncRNA/blob/main/output/filtered_count_matrix.tsv). Note: Counts need to be rounded before DESeq2 analysis

* These transcript IDs of the 22 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs can be found in a text file [here](https://github.com/course-fish546-2023/zach-lncRNA/blob/main/output/sig_diff_IDs.txt).

* The final differential gene expression results can be found [here](https://github.com/course-fish546-2023/zach-lncRNA/blob/main/output/DEGlist.tab).
